## Welcome to my first blog post!

This is a sample blog post written in MDX. MDX allows you to use React components within your Markdown content, giving you the best of both worlds.

### What is Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to use your favorite JavaScript frameworks while shipping less JavaScript to the browser.

```js
// Example Astro component
---
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
---

<Layout title="Hello, Astro!">
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</Layout>
```

### Why I chose Astro for this site

I chose Astro for this personal website because:

1. It offers excellent **performance** out of the box
2. It has great support for **Markdown and MDX**
3. It allows me to use **React components** where needed
4. It provides a smooth **developer experience**

### What's next?

In upcoming blog posts, I'll share more about:

- My experience working with Astro in a monorepo setup
- How I integrated shadcn/ui with Astro
- Performance optimizations for a blog site
- Best practices for content management

Stay tuned for more content!
